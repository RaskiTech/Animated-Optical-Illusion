# Animated-Optical-Illusion
Animate you images in real life with this tool.
You need a specific kind of paper for this to work. You need a paper that has vertical strips that hide parts of a paper that is under it.
Paper like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvvcRdwNhGM
If you have that paper you are good to go.

How to use:
Create a folder that holds all the images you want to use. Make sure they all are the same size. 
Then run this program and type the location of that folder when it asks it. 
After that, the new image will be created in that same folder. 
The animation order of the images is top down in the folder, so make sure they are in the correct order. 

Note:
The amount of frames a image can have usually depends on the paper with the strips. 
Also remember to print the image in the correct size. Otherwise the effect won't work
